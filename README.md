# 🐍 Python to ML Foundation

This repository documents my **daily learning journey of Python fundamentals, NumPy, and Pandas**, with the goal of building a **strong foundation before starting Machine Learning**.

Instead of rushing into ML algorithms, this repo focuses on **thinking clearly, understanding code behavior, and handling data properly**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Machine Learning is not just about models and formulas.  
It heavily depends on:

- Strong Python logic
- Clean and readable code
- Comfortable data handling
- Understanding *why* code behaves the way it does

This repository exists to strengthen those skills step by step.

## 📘 What I’m Learning Here

### 🔹 Core Python
- Conditions & loops
- Membership and logical operators
- Functions (default args, `*args`, `**kwargs`)
- Lambda expressions
- List comprehensions
- Dictionaries, sets, tuples
- File handling & JSON
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

### 🔹 NumPy
- Arrays & dimensions
- Indexing and slicing
- Reshaping
- Mathematical operations
- Iteration techniques

### 🔹 Pandas
- Series & DataFrames
- Data selection (`loc`, `iloc`)
- Filtering & conditions
- Handling missing values
- Sorting & grouping
- Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## 🧠 Learning Style

Each topic is learned using:
- Small and clear code snippets
- Output-prediction based examples
- Edge cases that improve logical thinking
- Simple explanations in a human way

Many examples are intentionally **slightly tricky** to improve understanding instead of memorization.
